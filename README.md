This allows developers to create unique designs tailored to their specific needs.

Tailwind CSS provides a vast array of utility classes that cover a range of design elements such as typography, spacing, colors, and more. These classes can be easily customized to match a project's unique requirements, and developers can add new classes to the framework to extend its functionality.
